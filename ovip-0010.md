# Abstract

This OVIP specifies the transport layer implementation for the OpenVASP protocol using Ethereum Whisper. It is a revision of the initial specification proposed in the OpenVASP White Paper.

# Specification

## 1. Ethereum Whisper

The Whisper messaging system has been developed as part of the Ethereum technology stack but can be used separately from the blockchain. It was designed to provide resilience and strong privacy in a peer-to-peer environment and targets message delivery below five seconds on a global scale.

The online documentation about the Whisper protocol can be found here: https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/whisper/whisper-overview.

## 2. Definitions

**Node**</br>
System operating a Whisper node providing the transport layer service for the OpenVASP protocol.

**Connection**</br>
Two *Nodes* sharing a common identifier representing a connection and an associated shared key, which can be used to exchange *Envelopes* containing an encrypted *Message*. Both *Nodes* have sent each other a Whisper topic to be used to send *Envelopes* related to this connection.

**Active Node**</br>
*Node* inviting another node to establish a *Connection*.

**Passive Node**</br>
*Node* responding to an invitation, either accepting or denying the *Connection*.

**Initiator**</br>
VASP operating the *Active Node*.

**Responder**</br>
VASP operating the *Passive Node*.

**Sender**</br>
VASP sending an *Envelope*.

**Receiver**</br>
VASP receiving an *Envelope*.

**Envelope**</br>
Envelopes are the packets sent and received by Whisper nodes. They contain the encrypted *Message* and metadata for decryption.

**Message**</br>
Message part of an *Envelope*, containing the message *Payload*, metadata and optional signature. Not to be confused with OpenVASP Messages, which are defined on the higher Session Layer.

**Payload**</br>
Actual message payload within a *Message* transmitted by an *Envelope*.

## 3. Envelope Level

Whisper *Envelopes* are the packets sent and received by Whisper nodes. Once decoded, they have the following format:

```pseudocode
[ Version, Expiry, TTL, Topic, AESNonce, Data, EnvNonce ]
```

The table below provides an overview about each of these elements and their usage as part of OpenVASP.

| Element    | Description                              | OpenVASP Usage                   | See  |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :--- |
| `Version`  | Currently one byte containing zero       | As per Whisper default           |      |
| `Expiry`   | UNIX time in seconds                     | As per Whisper default           |      |
| `TTL`      | Time-to-live in seconds                  | TTL recommendations              | 6.   |
| `Topic`    | Probabilistic hint about encryption key  | As per OpenVASP Envelope Types   | 5.   |
| `AESNonce` | Salt (96-bit) for symmetric encryption   | Randomly set for each *Envelope* |      |
| `Data`     | Contains encrypted Whisper *Message*     | Defined *Message* structure      | 4.   |
| `EnvNonce` | Nonce used for Proof-of-Work calculation | As per Whisper default           |      |

## 4. Message Level

Upon receipt of an *Envelope*, if the node detects a known topic, it tries to decrypt the `Data` element with the corresponding symmetric or asymmetric key. If decryption is successful, the *Message* is revealed with the following structure:

| Element     | Description                           | OpenVASP Usage               | See  |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------- | ---- |
| `flags`     | Flags to specifiy *Payload* structure | As per Whisper default       |      |
| `padding`   | Random padding data, optional         | As per Whisper default       |      |
| `payload`   | Message *Payload*                     | OpenVASP *Payload* structure | 4.1. |
| `signature` | Signature, optional                   | Not used                     |      |

### 4.1. OpenVASP Payload

The table below shows the structure of the OpenVASP *Payload*. The last four elements are present depending on the value of the `instruction` element.

| Element       | Length         | Present | Description                                       | See   |

| `envelopeACK` | 16 bytes       |         | Reference to an *Envelope* identifier             |       |
| `returnTopic` | 4 bytes        |         | Return topic                                      |       |
| `ecdhPK`      | 32 bytes       |         | ECDH public key                                   |       |
| `ovMessage`   | arbitrary size |         | Session Message (JSON)                            |       |

#### 4.1.1. Instructions

The `instruction` element can have the following values:

| Value | Sent by                    | Description                                        | Used in |
| ----- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `000` | *Active* or *Passive Node* | Acknowledge *Envelope* receipt (ACK)               | 5.6     |
| `001` | *Active Node*              | Inviting for a *Connection* (INVITE)               | 6.1     |
| `010` | *Passive Node*             | Accepting a *Connection* invitation (ACCEPT)       | 6.2     |

| `101` | *Active* or *Passive Node* | Closing a *Connection* (CLOSE)                     | 6.5     |

#### 4.1.2. Acknowledgment

*Nodes* must acknowledge the receipt of certain *Envelopes* by returning an OpenVASP *Envelope* of type ACK. The table below shows which Envelopes must be acknowledged.

| To be acknowledged | Envelopes with `instruction` value (see 4.1.1) |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| YES                | INVITE, ACCEPT, UPDATE, CLOSE                  |
| NO                 | DENY, ACK                                      |

## 5. Connections

This sections explains how the *Node* is internally handling *Connections* without being normative about the actual implementation.

### 5.1. Connection Set

Each *Node* maintains the set of *Connections* established with other *Nodes*. *Connections* have no state, they are either present (and therefore in the set) or not.

### 5.2. Permanent vs. Transient Connections

Each VASP using the OpenVASP protocol must be contactable via its VASP Identifier. The VASP's *Node* must therefore always have this *Connection* in its set, which is called the **Permanent** *Connection*.

A *Node* serving several VASPs (or a VASP group operating with different legal entities) might have several Permanent *Connections* in its set.

All other Connections are called **Transient** *Connections*, as they are only in the set as long as they are open.

### 5.3. Connection Properties

*Connections* have the following properties:

| Element         | Description                                                  | Value in case of a Transient Connection                    | Value in case of a Permanent Connection    |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| `isPermanent`   | Flag indicating whether this *Connection* is a Permanent *Connection* (see 5.2) | `False`                                                    | `True`                                     |
| `connection`    | *Connection* identifier                                      | *Connection* identifier                                    | VASP Identifier                            |
| `inboundTopic`  | Topic used to identify incoming *Envelopes* related to this *Connection* | Randomly set Topic                                         | VASP Identifier                            |
| `outboundTopic` | Topic used to label outgoing *Envelopes* related to this *Connection* | Topic received from connected *Node*                       | n/a                                        |
| `key`           | Key used to encrypt/decrypt *Envelopes* sent/received over this *Connection*. | Shared key to encrypt/decrypt outbound/inbound *Envelopes* | Private key to decrypt inbound *Envelopes* |

### 5.4. Outbound Envelope Queue

The *Node* maintains a queue of *Envelopes* sent in order to keep track whether their receipt has been acknowledged by the receiving *Node*. Only *Envelopes* that must be acknowledged are included in the queue (see 4.1.2).

Queue items have the following properties:

| Element      | Description                                                  |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `envelopeID` | *Envelope* identifier                                        |
| `envelope`   | *Envelope*                                                   |
| `expiry`     | Time when the waiting period for the acknowledgement of `envelope` ends and it is resent |
| `resends`    | Number of times `envelope` had to be resent                  |
| `connection` | Identifier of the associated *Connection*                    |

### 5.5. Validating Inbound Envelopes

Inbound *Envelopes* must be validated as per following steps.

1. Check whether `Topic` (see 3) is present as an `inboundTopic` in the *Connection* set (see 5.3).
2. Check whether `Data` (see 3) can be decrypted with the associated `key` in the Connection set (see 5.3).
3. Check whether the `payload` element of the decrypted message (see 4) conforms to the OpenVASP *Payload* (see 4.1).

If one of the above mentioned checks fail, the Envelope is ignored and deleted.

### 5.6. Acknowledging Inbound Envelopes

*Nodes* must acknowledge certain *Envelopes* (see 4.1.2) by returning an OpenVASP *Envelope* of type ACK.

If required, the *Envelope* is acknowledged as per following steps.

1. Read `connection` value from the *Payload* of the *Envelope* to be acknowledged.

2. Create the OpenVASP *Payload* out of the elements defined in 4.1 and the specified values in the table below.</br>

   | Element       | Value                                                        |
   | :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `instruction` | `000`                                                        |
   | `connection`  | `connection` value from the *Payload* of the *Envelope* to be acknowledged |
   | `envelopeACK` | `envelopeID` value from the *Payload* of the *Envelope* to be acknowledged |

   

3. Create *Envelope* out of the elements defined in sections 4. and 3. and the specified values in the table below</br>

   | Element | Value / Specification                                        |
   | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | `Topic` | `outboundTopic` value looked up in the *Connection* set based on matching `connection` values. |
   | `Data`  | *Payload* created in step 2, symmetrically encrypted (AES GCM algorithm as per Whisper standard) with `key` value looked up in the *Connection* set based on matching `connection` values. |

   

4. Send Envelope created in step 3.

## 6. Implementing the Session Layer

An OpenVASP Session knows four state changing operations:

- Initiating a Session,
- Responding to a Session Initiation,
- Ending a Session, and
- Aborting a Session.

The reader is recommended to consult OVIP-7 to understand the session model in full detail. This section describes how a conformant *Node* must implement the four above listed state changing operations.

### 6.1. Initiating a Session

#### 6.1.1. Active Node Initiates Session

##### 6.1.1.1. Session Layer Input

| Element          | Description                        | See                 |

| `receiver`       | VASP Identifier of the *Responder* | OVIP-7, section 2.1 |
| `sessionMessage` | Session Request Message JSON       | OVIP-7, section 4.1 |

##### 6.1.1.2. Processing steps

1. Retrieve public `transportKey` available from the `receiver`'s VASP Contract.

3. Generate random `connectionIdentifier`.

4. Generate random `topicA` the *Node* will listen for to identify incoming *Envelopes* sent over this *Connection*.

5. Generate ECDH private key (`ecdhPrivate`) and ECDH public key (`ecdhPublic`) based on the known `transportKey` using the X25519 key-exchange protocol.

6. Derive `sharedKey` based on `transportKey` and  `ecdhPrivate`.

8. Create the OpenVASP *Payload* out of the elements defined in 4.1 and the specified values in the table below.</br>

   | `Data`  | *Payload* created in step 6, asymmetrically encrypted with the `transportKey` using SECP-256k1 as per Whisper standard. |

   

8. Add item to the set of *Connections*:</br>

   | Element         | Value                  |
   | :-------------- | :--------------------- |
   | `isPermanent`   | `False`                |
   | `connection`    | `connectionIdentifier` |

   | `outboundTopic` | (empty)                |
   | `key`           | `sharedKey`            |



9. Add item to the Outbound *Envelope* Queue:</br>

   | Element      | Value                               |
   | :----------- | :---------------------------------- |

2. Generate random `topicB` the *Node* will listen for to identify incoming *Envelopes* sent over this *Connection*.

3. Derive `sharedKey` based on the *Responder's* own `transportKey` and `ecdhPK` received in step 1 using the X25519 key-exchange protocol.

4. Add item to the set of *Connections*:</br>

   | Element         | Value                                                  |
   | :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |

| Element       | Length         | Value                                                   |
| :------------ | :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `instruction` | 3 bits         | `101`                                                   |
| `ovMessage`   | arbitrary size | Encrypted OpenVASP Message as provided by higher layers |

### 5.6. ACK

Sent by an *Active Node* or a *Passive Node* to acknowledge the receipt of a *Message* sent over a *Connection*.

Besides the general specifications given on *Envelope*, *Message* and *Payload* Level, the following data items must be set as specified.

#### 5.6.1. Envelope

| Element | Value / Specification                                        |
| :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Topic` | Topic B (if sent by *Active Node*) or Topic A (if sent by *Passive Node*) |
| `Data`  | Content encrypted (symmetric, AES GCM, `AESNonce` as nonce) with the shared key |

#### 5.6.2. Payload

| Element       | Length  | Value                                             |
| :------------ | :------ | :------------------------------------------------ |
| `instruction` | 3 bits  | `000`                                             |
| `envelopeACK` | 4 bytes | `envelope` value of *Envelope* to be acknowledged |



## 6. Expected Node Behavior

### 6.1. Sending ACK

*Nodes* must acknowledge the receipt of an each *Envelope* containing the *OpenVASP Payload* by sending an OpenVASP *Envelope* of type ACK. The only exception are *Envelopes* of type ACK, which must not be acknowledged.

### 6.2. Responding to a missing ACK

*Nodes* must resend an *Envelope*, for which they do not receive an ACK within the period specified in its time-to-live (TTL).

*Nodes* should resend *Envelopes* not being acknowledged with increasingly larger TTL values (e.g. doubling the TTL with each resend).

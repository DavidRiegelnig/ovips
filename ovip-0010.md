# Abstract

This OVIP specifies the transport layer implementation for the OpenVASP protocol using Ethereum Whisper. It is a revision of the initial specification proposed in the OpenVASP White Paper.

# Specification

## 1. Ethereum Whisper

The Whisper messaging system has been developed as part of the Ethereum technology stack but can be used separately from the blockchain. It was designed to provide resilience and strong privacy in a peer-to-peer environment and targets message delivery below five seconds on a global scale.

The online documentation about the Whisper protocol can be found here: https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/whisper/whisper-overview.

## 2. Definitions

**Node**</br>
System operating a Whisper node implementing the transport layer for the OpenVASP protocol.

**Connection**</br>
Two *Nodes* sharing a common identifier representing a connection and an associated shared secret, which can be used to exchange encrypted messages. Both *Nodes* have sent each other a Whisper topic to be used to send messages related to this connection.

**Active Node**</br>
*Node* inviting another node to establish a *Connection*.

**Passive Node**</br>
*Node* responding to an invitation, either accepting or denying the *Connection*.

**Initiator**</br>
VASP operating the *Active Node*.

**Responder**</br>
VASP operating the *Passive Node*.

**Envelope**</br>
Envelopes are the packets sent and received by Whisper nodes. They contain the encrypted *Message* and metadata for decryption.

**Message**</br>
Message part of an *Envelope*, containing the message *Payload*, metadata and optional signature. Not to be confused with OpenVASP Messages, which are defined on the higher Session Layer.

**Payload**</br>
Actual message payload within a *Message* transmitted by an *Envelope*.

**OpenVASP Envelope Type**</br>
Envelope type with a defined structure on *Envelope*, *Message* and *Payload* level. The full set of Envelope Types implements the transport layer for the OpenVASP protocol.

## 3. Envelope Level

Whisper *Envelopes* are the packets sent and received by Whisper nodes. Once decoded, they have the following format:

```pseudocode
[ Version, Expiry, TTL, Topic, AESNonce, Data, EnvNonce ]
```

The table below provides an overview about each of these elements and their usage as part of OpenVASP.

| Element    | Description                              | OpenVASP Usage                   | See  |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :--- |
| `Version`  | Currently one byte containing zero       | As per Whisper default           |      |
| `Expiry`   | UNIX time in seconds                     | As per Whisper default           |      |
| `TTL`      | Time-to-live in seconds                  | TTL recommendations              | 6.   |
| `Topic`    | Probabilistic hint about encryption key  | As per OpenVASP Envelope Types   | 5.   |
| `AESNonce` | Salt used in symmetric encryption        | Randomly set for each *Envelope* |      |
| `Data`     | Contains encrypted Whisper *Message*     | Defined *Message* structure      | 4.   |
| `EnvNonce` | Nonce used for Proof-of-Work calculation | As per Whisper default           |      |

## 4. Message Level

Upon receipt of an *Envelope*, if the node detects a known topic, it tries to decrypt the `Data` element with the corresponding symmetric or asymmetric key. If decryption is successful, the *Message* is revealed with the following structure:

| Element     | Description                           | OpenVASP Usage               | See  |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------- | ---- |
| `flags`     | Flags to specifiy *Payload* structure | As per Whisper default       |      |
| `padding`   | Random padding data, optional         | As per Whisper default       |      |
| `payload`   | Message *Payload*                     | OpenVASP *Payload* structure | 4.1. |
| `signature` | Signature, optional                   | Not used                     |      |

### 4.1. OpenVASP Payload

The table below shows the structure of the OpenVASP *Payload*. The last four elements are present depending on the value of the `instruction` element.

| Element       | Length         | Present | Description                                       | See  |

| `ecdhPK`      | 32 bytes       |         | ECDH public key                                   |      |
| `ovMessage`   | arbitrary size |         | OpenVASP Message payload for higher layers        |      |

#### 4.1.1 Instructions

The `instruction` element can have the following values:

| Value | Name   | Sent by                | Intention                           | See  |

## 5. OpenVASP Envelope Types

Six *OpenVASP Envelopes Types* are defined to implement the transport layer for the OpenVASP protocol. They are reflected by the six values of the `instruction` element (see 4.1.1) and are specified below.

### 5.1. Initiating a Session

1. Input: Session Request Message JSON as specified in OVIP-7, section 4.1 (`sessionMessage`) containing the `receiver`.

2. Generate random `connectionIdentifier`.

3. Generate random `topicA` the *Active Node* will listen for to identify incoming *Envelope* sent over the *Connection*.

4. Generate ECDH private key (`ecdhPrivate`) and ECDH public key (`ecdhPublic`) based on the elliptic curve Diffieâ€“Hellman (ECDH) key-exchange protocol.

5. Derive `sharedKey` based on the public `transportKey` available from the `receiver`'s' VASP Contract and `ecdhPublic` generated in the previous step.

6. Create the OpenVASP *Payload* out of the elements defined in 4.1 and the specified values in the table below.</br>

   | Element       | Length         | Value                  |
   | :------------ | :------------- | :--------------------- |
   | `instruction` | 3 bits         | `001`                  |
   | `connection`  | 4 bytes        | `connectionIdentifier` |
   | `returnTopic` | 4 bytes        | `topicA`               |
   | `ecdhPK`      | 32 bytes       | `ecdhPublic`           |
   | `ovMessage`   | arbitrary size | `sessionMessage`       |

   </br>

7. Create the Envelope out of the elements defined in 3. and the specified values in the table below.</br>

   | Element | Value / Specification                                        |
   | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `Topic` | *Responder's* VASP Identifier                                |
   | `Data`  | Content encrypted (asymmetric, SECP-256k1) with the public `transportKey` available from the *Responder's* VASP Contract |

   </br>

## 6. Expected Node Behavior

### 6.1. Sending ACK

*Nodes* must acknowledge the receipt of an each *Envelope* containing the *OpenVASP Payload* by sending an OpenVASP *Envelope* of type ACK. The only exception are *Envelopes* of type ACK, which must not be acknowledged.

### 6.2. Responding to a missing ACK

*Nodes* must resend an *Envelope*, for which they do not receive an ACK within the period specified in its time-to-live (TTL).

*Nodes* should resend *Envelopes* not being acknowledged with increasingly larger TTL values (e.g. doubling the TTL with each resend).

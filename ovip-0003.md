# Abstract

The OpenVASP protocol uses Ethereum smart contracts as its public key infrastructure.

Each Virtual Assets Service Provider (VASP) deploys its own **VASP Contract** that represents the identity of the VASP and that stores the public keys required by the protocol.

VASP Contracts are deployed via a universal smart contract factory, the **Index Contract**, which maintains a register of all deployed VASP Contracts.

When a VASP Contract is deployed, the VASP can specify a unique **VASP Code** as an identifier, which can henceforth be used to retrieve the VASP Contract from the Index Contract.

This OVIP specifies the interface of the VASP Contract and the Index Contract, which together set the rules how a VASP can establish its identity within the OpenVASP protocol. It is a revision of the initial specification proposed in the OpenVASP White Paper.

# Specification

## VASP Code

The VASP Code consists of 8 hexadecimal characters and is a unique identifier for the VASP Contract representing the VASP's identity.

It can be freely chosen by the VASP out of all possible combinations still available when the VASP Contract is deployed (see sections below).

## VASP Identifier

The Index Contract implements the Addressing Layer as described in [ovip-0009](). There can be multiple implementations of this layer and even multiple istances of the Index Contract.

To ensure global uniqueness, the **VASP Code Type** specifies for which implementation of the Addressing Layer the VASP Code is registered (see [ovip-0002]()).

The combination of the VASP Code Type and the VASP Code globally, uniquely identifies a VASP and is referred to as the **VASP Identifier**.

## Index Contract

The Index Contract serves as a universal smart contract factory and is deployed only once by the OpenVASP Association. It has no owner with special privileges.

### Functions

```pseudocode
createVaspContract(owner:address, vaspCode:bytes8): address {public}
```

**Description:**  
Deploys a VASP Contract, owned by `owner` and returns the address of the deployed contract. The Index Contract records the deployed contract's address under the specified `vaspCode` in its internal mapping.

**Conditions:**  
`address` must be a valid Ethereum address; and  
`vaspCode` must be unique in the internal mapping of the Index Contract, that is, `vaspCode` must have never been used in a successful call of this function before.

**Use Case:**  
Called by a VASP to deploy a VASP Contract that represents the identity of the VASP within the OpenVASP protocol and that is mapped to a unique VASP Code chosen by the VASP.

```pseudocode
getVaspByCode(vaspCode:bytes8): address {public}
```

**Description:**  
Returns the address of the VASP Contract which has been recorded under the specified `vaspCode`. If no entry is found in the internal mapping, an empty address (0x) is returned by the function.

**Use Case:**  
Called to get the VASP Contract which is uniquely assigned to a specific VASP Code. Intended method to retrieve a VASP Contract.

```pseudocode
getVaspCode(vaspContract:address): bytes8 {public}
```

**Description:**  
Returns the VASP Code that was assigned to the specified `vaspContract` by the Index Contract. If no entry is found in the internal mapping, an empty address (0x) is returned by the function.

**Use Case:**  
Called to get the VASP Code which is uniquely mapped to a given VASP Contract address.

## VASP Contract

Each VASP participating in the OpenVASP protocol deploys and owns a dedicated VASP Contract, representing the VASP's identity.

The VASP Contract is used to provide the public keys required to decrypt and verify protocol messages that were signed and sent by the VASP. In addition, the VASP Contract can store pointers to registries, where credentials associated with that 

VASP Contracts can only be deployed together with a unique VASP Code and via the Index Contract, which keeps track of all deployed VASP Contracts and their respective VASP Code. Each VASP Contract can always be retrieved from the Index Contract by the associated VASP Code.

The owner of the VASP Contract can change the public keys and can transfer ownership.

### State Variables

```pseudocode
owner: address {internal}
candidateOwner: address {internal}
handshakeKey: string {public}
signingKey: string {public}
```

### Functions

```pseudocode
transferOwnership(newOwner:address): bool {public}
```

**Description:**  
Sets the contract's state variable `candidateOwner` to the specified `newOwner`.

**Conditions:**  
None

**Use Case:**  
Called by the contract owner to prepare the transfer of the contract's ownership to a new owner.

```pseudocode
acceptOwnership(): bool {public}
```

**Description:**  
Sets the contract's state variable `owner` to `candidateOwner` and returns `true`.  
Returns `false` if condition is not met.

**Conditions:**  
Function is called by the address that is stored in state variable `candidateOwner`.

**Use Case:**  
Called by the future owner in order to accept transfer of the contract's ownership.

```pseudocode
setHandshakeKey(newKey: string)
```

**Description:**  
Sets the contract's state variable `handshakeKey` to `newKey`.

**Conditions:**  
Function is called by the address that is stored in state variable `owner`.

**Use Case:**  
Owner changes the public key required to establish an OpenVASP session and to decrypt messages sent.

```pseudocode
setSigningKey(newKey: string)
```

**Description:**  
Sets the contract's state variable `signingKey` to `newKey`.

**Conditions:**  
Function is called by the address that is stored in state variable `owner`.

**Use Case:**  
Owner changes the public key required to verify message signatures.

# Motivation

- Community feedback -- This OVIP reflects community feedback on the initial VASP Contract specification suggested in the OpenVASP White Paper.
- Clarity -- OpenVASP implementation teams need clarity about the VASP identity mechanism to complete a first version of interoperable implementations.

# Rationale

###### Decentralized approach

The specification maintains its decentralized approach by allowing the VASP to self-assign a VASP Code and deploy the VASP Contract without having to go through a central authority.

###### Reduced VASP Contract

One of the key changes to the initial design proposal is the reduction of the VASP Contract to a minimal record for public keys. This is done for the following reasons:

- Separating identity from verification -- The protocol's trust model has always seen identity verification by trusted third parties as an additional layer on top of peer-to-peer trust. Consequently, identity attributes (such as name, address, etc.) are better stored where these attributes are actually verified. Omitting identity attributes from the self-assigned VASP Contract on the other hand avoids any false sense of security from these unverified properties.
- Simplicity -- The revised specification simplifies smart contract design.
- Interoperability -- A reduced VASP Contract together with the layered approach to identity verification allows for easier interoperability with other mechanisms for identity management, e.g. used by other travel rule solutions.

###### VASP Code

Maintaining the VASP Code as an identifier for the VASP Contract is done for practicality in (human) processing and its use in the Virtual Assets Account Number (VAAN). See OVIP-2 for more details about the VAAN.

###### Indirect retrieval of the VASP Contract via the Index Contract

The VASP Code is not stored in the VASP Contract, but only in the internal mapping of the Index Contract. In this way, developers interacting with these smart contracts are constantly reminded to always retrieve the VASP Contract from the source (Index Contract) by the help of the `getVaspByCode()` function.

###### Smart contract ownership

The Index Contract It has no owner with special privileges to rule out any unwanted influence on this security-critical component after deployment.

For the VASP Contract, the ability to transfer ownership is considered a must to deal with situations like change of ownership of the VASP entity or a compromised private key.

###### Identity verification

Ways to verify the VASP's identity will be covered in a separate OVIP.

# Backwards Compatibility

The specification proposed in this OVIP is not backwards compatible.

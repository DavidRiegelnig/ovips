## Abstract

When writing an implementation, we discovered the need for the transport layer reliability, e.g. guaranteed message delivery. Since in Whisper it is not guaranteed (for example if the TTL of the message is longer then the downtime of the Beneficiary VASP), the Originator has no way of knowing if SessionRequest (or TransferRequest, or any other message) has been received by Beneficiary and is being reviewed or it hasn't been received for some reason. Since the review process can potentially take days, it means that whole days can be lost. The problem is that on top of the fact that we can't know whether or not the message has been received, currently, there is no mechanism described in WP for handling such situations.

## Specification

### General Description

In order to fix the issue with unreliability, we suggest several changes:

### 1. Message idempotency

Make all messages idempotent so they can be resent any number of times, with the first received message being acted upon and all subsequent ones being ignored. This is possible for all messages, based on their content.

### 2. Ack message

#### 2.1. Description

Let's imagine a flow to get a better feel of it: Originator VASP (OV) sends a Session Request with a TTL of 10 minutes. Since the processing of this request may take time, the OV expects a Session Request Ack message from the Beneficiary VASP (BV) right away, to make sure the message was received. If the Ack message wasn't received after the TTL of the Session Request message (10 minutes), the OV sends the Session Request message again. This time it is received by the BV and it responds with a Session Request Ack, now the OV knows everything is fine. If, after some number of such retries from the OV side they still don't receive an Ack, OV considers a session "interrupted" and is marked as such on OV's side. As it is a form of timeout for the underlying business process, let's call that a "technical timeout". Let's say the OV received an Ack message for the Session Request but after some time (several hours for example), the BV doesn't send out the Session Reply, OV will still consider that a timeout and will also mark the session as interrupted. Let's call that a "business" timeout. The number of retries before technical timeout occurs and the amount of time that needs to pass before a business timeout occurs, should be configurable on the level of session. Each VASP should decide, for a given session on their side, what constraints would make sense, they can use the same or different settings based on their needs. We can also promote recommended TTL-s for messages, so that everyone has approximately the same number in mind. Also an important thing to mention would be that we don't have to make Ack messages mandatory - in case a VASP can respond with the next message from the current flow right away, it should be able to do so and this message would count as an Ack from the anticipating VASP. This is possible for the OV messages, since it's usually BV who takes time to process inputs.

#### 2.2. Message structure

|  Level 1  |     Level 2      |  Name  |     Type    |  Mult.  |       Comment        |
|-----------|------------------|--------|-------------|---------|----------------------|
|  Message  |                  |   msg  |             |   1..1  |                      |
|           |Message Type      |  type  | String      |   1..1  | Fixed value '920'    |
|           |Message Identifier| msgid  |Hex(128-bit) |   1..1  |  Randomly set        |
|           |Session Identifier| session|Hex(128-bit) |   1..1  |As set in message 110 |
|           |Message Code      |  code  |  String     |   1..1  | See 2.3              |

#### 2.3. Message codes

1 = Session Reply Ack

2 = Transfer Request Ack

3 = Transfer Dispatch Ack

4 = Termination Ack

#### 2.4. Scenarios

##### 2.4.1
```
OV settings:
Transfer Request message TTL: 10 min
Transfer Request max number of retries: 5

BV settings:
(doesn’t matter in this case)

00:00 OV sends out Transfer Request
00:01 BV receives Transfer Request and responds with Transfer Request Ack
00:02 OV receives Transfer Request Ack and knows that processing on the BV side has begun
05:00 BV sends out Transfer Reply
```
##### 2.4.2
```
OV settings:
Transfer Request message TTL: 10 min
Transfer Request max number of retries: 5

BV settings:
(doesn’t matter in this case)

00:00 OV sends out Transfer Request
00:00 BV experiences downtime for the following 25 minutes
00:10 OV sends out the same Transfer Request, since BV hasn’t responded with Ack
00:10 BV still in downtime
00:20 OV sends out the same Transfer Request, since BV hasn’t responded with Ack
00:20 BV still in downtime
00:25 BV recovers from the downtime and sees pending Transfer Request, sent at 00:20, processes it and responds with a Transfer Request Ack
00:26 OV receives Transfer Request Ack and knowing that BV has received the message stops retries
```
## Motivation

Reliability - The OpenVASP Whie Paper specifies Whisper as the only transport protocol at the moment and while other protocols might guarantee delivery, it's necessary to fix this issue at the early stages of the protocol for adaptiblity.

## Rationale

Minimal adjustment - This is the simplest solution and only introduces one new type of message.
